# clients/

Place client-side code here. Examples:

- `jetbrains-plugin/` — the IntelliJ plugin (Kotlin/Java + Gradle)
- `web-ui/` — any browser-based UIs or admin consoles (Node / React / Vite)

Guidance

- Keep build outputs inside each client folder (they are gitignored by the top-level `.gitignore`).
- Prefer separate repositories for large clients later; for now the monorepo keeps everything discoverable.
